You are given a collection of  non-empty strings, denoted by s. Then you are given n-1 operations which you 
execute in the order they are given. The i’th  operation is has the following format: ‘a b’ (1-based indexing 
without the quotes), which means that you have to make the following changes:
1. S(a) = S(a) + S(b) : i.e. concatenate a’th string and b’th string and store the result in the a’th string.
2. S(b) = "", i.e. make the b’th string empty after doing the previous step.

You are ensured that after the i’th operation, there will be no future operation that will be accessing S(b). 
Given these operations to join strings, print the last string that will remain at the end of this process.
 The first line contains an integer 
N (1≤N≤(10^5)) denoting the number of strings given. Each of the next 
N lines contains a string denoting the S(i). All the characters in the string 
S(a) are lowercase alphabets from ‘a’ to ‘z’. The total number of characters over all the strings is at most 
(10)^2. where |S(i)| denotes the length of the i’th string.

Print the last string which remains at the end of the N-1 operations.
